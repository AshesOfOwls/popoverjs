The Storybook Links addon can be used to create links that navigate between stories in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org).

This addon works with Storybook for:
- [React](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/app/react)
- [React Native](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/app/react-native)
- [Vue](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/app/vue)

## Getting Started

Install this addon by adding the `@storybook/addon-links` dependency:
```sh
yarn add @storybook/addon-links
```

First configure it as an addon by adding it to your addons.js file (located in the Storybook config directory).

```js
import '@storybook/addon-links/register';
```

Then you can import `linkTo` in your stories and use like this:

```js
import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react'
import { linkTo } from '@storybook/addon-links'

storiesOf('Button', module)
  .add('First', () => (
    <button onClick={linkTo('Button', 'Second')}>Go to "Second"</button>
  ))
  .add('Second', () => (
    <button onClick={linkTo('Button', 'First')}>Go to "First"</button>
  ));
```

Have a look at the linkTo function:

```js
import { linkTo } from '@storybook/addon-links'

linkTo('Toggle', 'off')
linkTo(() => 'Toggle', () => 'off')
linkTo('Toggle') // Links to the first story in the 'Toggle' kind
```

With that, you can link an event in a component to any story in the Storybook.

-   First parameter is the the story kind name (what you named with `storiesOf`).
- Â  Second (optional) parameter is the story name (what you named with `.add`). If the second parameter is omitted, the link will point to the first story in the given kind.

> You can also pass a function instead for any of above parameter. That function accepts arguments emitted by the event and it should return a string. <br/>
> Have a look at [PR86](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook/pull/86) for more information.
